## INTRO 
This is an app that allows you to register, login, and once inside, create an avatar.

Once the **_Avatar_** is created & custimized, we'll have the option of entering into a isometric 3D room.

In this room we will be able to interact with other person's avatar via chat (__atm__), explore the room, send emotions and interact with some objects. 

We can also admin friends area, adding and deleting friends, see who's online and where. 

We can use this app just for fun, interact with others with an immersive 3D experience or we can use it as a communication Tools in workspaces.
